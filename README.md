## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About This Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, experience, and technical expertise. Built with a focus on clean design, smooth user experience, and modern web technologies.

## ü§ñ AI Transparency

This portfolio was developed with the assistance of AI tools for code generation, refactoring, and problem-solving. However, I want to be transparent about what was and wasn't AI-generated:

- **AI-assisted development**: Used for code structure, component organization, styling, and technical implementation
- **No AI-generated images**: All images and visual assets are either created manually or sourced appropriately
- **Verified content**: All information presented (projects, experience, education, skills) is accurate and verified

I believe in transparency about the tools and processes used in development, and I'm always happy to discuss the technical implementation in detail.

I want to emphasize that I am open to projects that use AI and those that don't. It's up to team preference. Unfortunately, it seems nearly impossible to completely avoid AI use in the current state of computing. To read more about the environmental impact of AI, see [here](https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117).
